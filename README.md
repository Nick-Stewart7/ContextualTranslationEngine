The Contextual Translation Engine is a GenAI-powered translation tool that aims to improve linguistic accuracy and cultural sensitivity by generating translations with deeper context awareness and accuracy than traditional machine translation.

CTE reflects the power of GenAI in areas requiring empathy, precision, and cultural intelligence. It’s a step toward translation systems that don’t just convert words—but carry meaning. Ideal for legal, medical, and international SaaS use cases. In my experiments and testing the translations created by this GenAI tool were perfered 2 to 1 on average across languages compared to traditional ML translations generated by AWS Translate. In some languages such as Korean and Chinese CTE was able to generate translations that were perfered every single time by native speakers. This tool showcases the power LLMs hold to break down linguistic and cultural barriers to promote unity across the globe.

Tech Stack:

Python

AWS Bedrock

Prompt engineering (zero-shot + few-shot)

Streamlit UI for interface

What It Does:

Translates input text across languages with prompts designed to preserve nuance, tone, and intent

Accepts context cues (e.g., target audience, domain, tone) to modify the translation strategy

Demonstrates GenAI’s ability to go beyond literal translation by handling slang, idioms, and culture-bound expressions

How to run locally:

pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

Future Plans:

Add tone classifier to tailor translations (e.g., professional vs. conversational)
